This is a  full-stack election system for managing voters, ballots, initiatives, and results at scale.
Built with Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL, JWT role-based auth, Redis caching, and Pino logging.
Designed to simulate enterprise workloads (20k+ users, 1.4M+ votes) with auditing, analytics views, and robust DB features (materialized views, triggers, PL/pgSQL).

## Highlights
- Realistic Scale: 20K+ users, 1.4M+ votes
- Secure auth: JWTs with granular roles & permissions.
- DB power features: materialized views, triggers, stored functions for eligibility & analytics.
- Performance: Redis caching + indexed queries; Pino structured logs.
- Auditing: append-only audit trail for admin actions & ballot events.
